## Overview

The goal of this project is to investigate Amazon product review helpfulness ratings and make related predictions in regard to natural language processing. The data is accessed [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt). Machine learning and deep learning methods such as random forests, LSTM networks, GRU networks, and bidirectional RNNs are implemented and evaluated.
